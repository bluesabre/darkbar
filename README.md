# Darkbar

![Screenshot](data/screenshots/1x.png?raw=true)

**Darkbar** replaces window decorations with your preference of a dark or light theme variant.

It allows the following settings for each application:

- None: Let the application decide
- Follow System Theme: Use the same theme as the operating system
- Light: Prefer the "light" theme variant
- Dark: Prefer the "dark" theme variant

Only applications using traditional decorations are supported. If your app is unaffected by Darkbar, the application controls its window decorations.
